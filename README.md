## INTRODUCTION
<p align='justify'> Sperm morphological analysis is widely used for therapy of infertility which are applied to select superior breeding in reproductive biomedical field. Understanding morphological features and quantitating the distribution improve the sperm analysis process to maximise reproductive fertility. This study is expected to contribute not only to the meat production industry, but also to the medical field such as cure of sterility nad infertility. </p>
